# Definition of Aritificial intelligence
- Thinking vs Acting
- Humanly vs Rationally

## Acting Humanly
If the response of a computer to an unrestricted textual natural-language conversation cannot be distinguished from that of a human being then the computer can be said to be intelligent.

At what point do you believe that software is sentient, and not just supplying the best possible answer?

## Thinking Humanly
Must not just exhibit bahaviour sufficient to fool a human judge but must do it in a way demonstrably analogous to human cognition.


## Thinking Rationally
Formalise "right" reasoning using a mathematical model (deductive reasoning).

Encode knowledge in formal logical statements and use mathematical deduction to perform reasoning.

However formalising common sense is difficult.

## Acting Rationally
An agent is an entity that perceives its environment and is able to execute actions to change it.

Have inherent goal they want ot achieve.

Acts in a way to maximise the achievemnt of its goals.

True maximisation requires omniscience and unlimited computational abilities

Limited rationality involves maximising goals within the computational and information available.

# Foundations of
An interdisciplinary approach
- Philosophers
- Mathematicians
- Economists
- Neuroscientists
- Psychologists
- Computer engineers

# Knowledge-based systems (70-80s)
Expert systems: elicit specific domain knowledge from experts in the form of rules: `if [premise] then conclusion`

Examples
- DENDRAL: infer molecular structure from mass spectrometry
- MYCIN: diagnose blood infections, recommend antibiotics
- XCON: convert customer orders into parts specification

Problems
- Knowledge is not deterministic rules, needs to be modelled with uncertainty
- Requires considerable manual effort to create rules, hard to maintain

# Rise of Neural Networks (80s-present)
## Symbolic vs Sub-symbolic
**Symbolic AI** focuses on the high-level symbolic (human-readable) representation of problems, logic, and search. Leads to high explainability but low accuracy performance.

**Sub-symbolic** is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on deriving the relationship from the learning from experience with no symbolic represntation of rules and properties. Leads to low explainability but high accuracy performance.

**Sub-symbolic** leads to biases in AI, being acurate is not enough.

# Neats vs Scruffies
**Neats** use algorithms based on formal paradigms. Believes that single formal paradigm can be extended and improved to achieve general intelligence and superintelligence.

**Scruffies** use any number of different algorithms and methods to achieve intelligent behavior. Believes that the general intelligence can only be implemented by solving a large number of essentially unrelated problems, and that there is no magic bullet that will allow programs to develop general intelligence autonomously.

# Modern AI (90s-present)
- Probability: Bayesian networks in AI to model uncertainty


- Machine learning: Vector machines to tune parameters (based on statistical models)

Shift of focus from rule-based and logical methods to probabilistic and statistical methods (Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models)

Increased interest in particular tasks and applications.

AI is still a young field at 60+ years old. With cycles of success, misplaced optimism, and resulting cutbacks in enthusiasm and funding.
